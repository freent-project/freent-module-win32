# Win32 for OpenWindows

A FreeNT module for running and installing Microsoft Windows programs.

## Why not include Win32 with OpenWindows?

FreeNT is an open-source project. Win32 is a proprietary product. The goal
of FreeNT is to "create the Windows kernel without proprietary code", so Win32
cannot be included within FreeNT itself.

This FreeNT module adds support for Win32. This is an important part of
OpenWindows.
